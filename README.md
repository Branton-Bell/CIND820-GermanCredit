### Project Overview

This is a comparison study of binary classification machine learning models. The German Credit Data dataset will be used to train and test various binary classification models.  Upon completing of this study the goal  is to replicate the findings of academic peers that XGBoost offer the best binary classification performance measured by ROC AUC. 

### IDE

#### Google Colab

Google Colab is the primary IDE used by this study

Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) lets users write and execute Python code in a web browser, with free access to GPUs and easy sharing of notebooks. Itâ€™s widely used for prototyping, collaborating, and learning, especially in fields like data analytics and AI.

[Google Colab](https://colab.google/) is the IDE selected to complete this project.

#### Environment Notes

_File Importing_

Required files are saved locally and uploaded using upload.() to Google Colab - should you wish to run this Python Notebook locally you will need to edit the import to support your personal development enviroment. 

_Required Libraries_ 

This study relies heavily on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) but also uses several other established Python libraries. 

See [PythonLibraries](PythonLibraries.ipynb) for a comprehsive list of libraries used. 


### German Credit Dataset 


_Raw Dataset_

The German Credit Dataset is publically accessible from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data) and in this github repository. 

The raw dataset consists of 1,000 observed instances classifing individuals as having good or bad credit. A strong imbalance is a prevailing characteristic as majority of instances have good credit in this dataset. Each instance is comprised of 20 attributes split between 4 numeric and 16 categorical. Evidently the raw dataset does not possess any missing values, but this study determined transformation, scaling, and sampling will be required prior to testing various classification models.
